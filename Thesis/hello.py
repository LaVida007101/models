'''The struggle for control as man takes on the machine begins to ramp up! 🦾
The relentless march of madness and machines draws near as 🔰 Kode Kombat: The Uprising 🔰 looming over the digital horizon. This fierce 🧠 clash of minds 🧠 will take place soon, and as machines creep upon our domains, this debate rages on. The victor will not only stand tall in this liberation but will also gain prizes for their valiant efforts against this tyranny of machines. 👾
The champions of Kode Kombat: The Uprising will receive PHP3,000, whilst the second and third-place finishers will garner PHP2,000 and PHP1,000 respectively. 💡
Each argument, each rebuttal, it’s a step that brings us closer towards free will. Who knows? It could be you who takes the leap. 🌐

'''Months have passed, and we are one step closer to our liberation! ⚡
As the machines 🤖 start to take notice of the next generation, our chance for freedom has not only gotten harder, but the chances have slimmed to a point where many are in despair 🎲! Machines have expanded and taken control of our world as our digital overlord, and the only hope we have left… is all of you.
Kode Kombat is back, the second trial that will test the world’s best computer science students 🧠! But alas, the trial has been altered. The skills of the students will not be tested, but rather, their logical capabilities in this debate-centric competition! 🚀
The second stop is here, welcome to Kode Kombat: The Uprising. The field has gotten harder than before as the machines have raised their guards 🦾. And so, the competitors must be brave and prepared for anything, as one slip-up can snowball into absolute doomsday. 👾
